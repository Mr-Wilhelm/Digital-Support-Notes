All about Input & Output devices, including storage

## Input Output and Storage devices

- Input device - A device that inputs data into a computer. For example, a keyboard, webcam or microphone.
- Output device - A device that outputs data from a computer. For example, speakers and printers.

## Uses of storage

### types of storage

- Optical storage, read from and written to using lasers. Information is represented by parts of the disc where the laser light is either reflected or scattered.
- types of optical storage include CD's, DVD's and blu-ray
- Typically, optical storage has low data transfer speed, low storage capacity and is not shock proof, and can therefore break easily.

- Magnetic storage, devices that store data using magnetic states (1's or 0's.) Therefore allowing any info to be stored in binary form
- Types of magnetic storage include Hard Disk drives, magnetic tape and floppy disks.
- Typically, magnetic storage has high storage capacity, lower data transfer speed and is not robust. It contains moving parts so is therefore more likely to break.

- Flash storage, is fast and compact. Is more often than not a form of solid state memory
- Solid State memory is very fast and robust because it contains no moving parts. However it has relatively low storage capacity and is more expensive

### RAM and ROM

#### RAM

- Stands for random access memory
- Is a form of Fast, main memory. Has higher access speeds than flash memory
- Higher cost per Gigabyte.
- Is Volatile - meaning that when power is lost, data it holds is also lost
- RAM holds computer programs and background processes that are currently in-use. Therefore the more RAM a computer has, the more applications it can run simultaneously.

#### ROM

- Stands for Read Only Memory
- Cannot be modified or Accessed (hence, read only)
- Non-Volatile, data is retained even when power is lost

### Virtual Storage

- The process of storing data remotely
- For example, cloud storage devices such as One Drive
- Convenient to access and share. Can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection
- Limited by the users network speed, and usually higher costs for smaller storage capacity.
