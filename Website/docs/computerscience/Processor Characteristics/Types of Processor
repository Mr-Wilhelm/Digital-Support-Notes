Information about different types of processors and co-processors

## RISC and CISC processors

### Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)

- Small set of instructions
- Each instruction takes up approximately one line of machine code
- Each instruction takes one clock cycle to complete

### Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)

- Large set of instructions
- Aims to accomplish tasks in as few lines of machine code as possible
- Instructions are built into the hardware
- Mostly used in microcontrollers and embedded systems

### Comparisons between the two

- RISC requires more work from the compiler
- RISC requires more RAM to store the code
- RISC allows pipelining

### Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

- Is a co-processor, which has lots of independant processors included.
- The independant processors work in parallel with one another.
- Efficient for graphics/image rendering, and for AI/machine learning
